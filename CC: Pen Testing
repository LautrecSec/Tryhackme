GoBuster time to smash through some directories

GoBuster has shown us there is a /secret page we can visit, but when we navigate there in chrome it is an empty body. We can tell at the very least that secret is a directory, so lets gobuster it again.

Hmm nothing, lets check for files with .txt extensions.

Read the contents of secret.txt with a browser or cURL, and use the credentials to connect to ssh.


Hashed?
HashID
Run the hash through hashid to see what kind of hash it is. Use the -m flag to see the correlating hashcat mode

Hashcat
hashid thinks it is most likely a SHA1 hash. Crack the hash with hashcat using the mode provided by hashid.


Ssh
Connect with the cracked credentials and you’ll find the user flag in nyan’s home directory.

PrivEsc
sudo -l
Check the users sudo privileges.

and from here we get the first flag.
