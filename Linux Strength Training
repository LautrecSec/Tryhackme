Hashing!

login to the server using sara with the password listed

locate and identify hashA

f9d4049dd6a4dc35d40e5265954b2a46

password from john shows md4 file= admin

Password from HashC.txt

unacvaolipatnuggi

now we use John to rip hashB.txt and extract it's password

finding the layered files!

layer4 = 1. Find a file called layer3.txt, its password is james.   

Layer3 = 1. Find a file called layer2.txt, its password is tony.  

Layer 2 = base64 encoded file = 1. Find a file called layer1.txt, its password is hacked
 
Layer 1 = Flag{B07$f854f5ghg4s37}

(2020-08-13) Sarah: Hey Lucy, what happened to the database server? It is completely down now!          
                                                                                                        
(2020-08-13) Lucy: Yes, I believe we have had a problem. I will need to investigate but for now there wi
ll be downtime for who knows how long.                                                                  
                                                                                                        
(2020-08-13) Sarah: That is a shame, I needed to refer to a customer’s record due to them being unhappy 
with our service yesterday.                                                                             
                                                                                                        
(2020-08-13) Lucy: if you ask Sameer, he may be able to help you find the back-up database copy we made 
a few hours ago?                                                                                        
                                                                                                        
(2020-08-13) Sarah: Of course, he is one of the sql developers around here in charge of the database cre
ation, I will ask him in a few minutes. Thank you.                                                      
                                                                                                        
(2020-08-13) Lucy: No problem. By the way, our new security engineer may have accidently stored the SSH 
password of one of our employees. I have no idea how to change it and he will not be back till tomorrow.
                                                                                                        
(2020-08-13) Sarah: That is a shame. I am sure we will all be fine till he returns. Do you know which em
ployee it is?                                                                                           
                                                                                                        
(2020-08-13) Lucy: I think it may have affected James but I not entirely sure.                          
                                                                                                        
(2020-08-13) Sarah: That is terrible, but I am sure nothing will come of it, he will be back tomorrow.  
                                                                                                        
(2020-08-13) Lucy: True. It is just a concern of mine because James is the only one with root access. But as you said, we should be ok. Talk to you later. Bye.
